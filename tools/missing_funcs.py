"""Adds the branch targets codegen could not place to missing_funcs.toml.

Codegen fails with lines such as
    0x82120140 from 0x824B4B2C: b 0x82120140 from 0x824B4B2C - target not in any function
Each such target is a function the analysis did not find on its own. This script reads a codegen
log, adds every new target to missing_funcs.toml as a function start (codegen finds its end) and
keeps the entries already there. Run codegen again afterwards; repeat until it passes.

A game log works too: the game stops with
    [FATAL] Call to invalid or unregistered function at guest address 0x82634F78
for a function reached through a pointer that tools/find_missing_funcs.py did not find. That address is added the
same way.

Usage: python tools/missing_funcs.py runs/codegen.log   (or a game log)
